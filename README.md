### Features
* **Save game mode:** After you chose your character and make it through the forst couple of towns, you might need a break. Don't worry, you can save your game and load it again later
* **In-game e-commerce:** Use drag and drop to shop at the local armory, blacksmith and apothocary to load up on supplies
* **In-game mini game:** Between towns use your character (aka circle) to kill the bad guys (aka the other cirlces) and see how much damage you take
* **Batman mode:** If you are like me, you need a little leg up, so we developed Batman mode - enough money and health to help you make it to the end!
